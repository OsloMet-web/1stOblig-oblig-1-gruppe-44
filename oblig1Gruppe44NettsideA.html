        DATA1200 is an introduction to HTML and CSS, and the Accessibility-guidelines WCAGLinks to an external site.
        Few people currently code directly in HTML, CSS. Rather, we use tools that create HTML and CSS for us; content management platforms, low- code or even no-code tools. However, a basic knowledge about web languages, design and possibilities are expected by most employers. After all, HTML, CSS and JS are the foundation of the Web.
        And when you learn JavaScript next semester (in DATA1700), you must know some basic HTML. The majority of bachelor thesis will have a webpage as a customer-facing interface.
