    At my old high school the sports hall where we had our PE classes was 
    bigger and more modern than the main teaching building. 
    In the main teaching building all the doors on the ground floor was painted red, 
    the ones on the first floor was blue, and all the doors at the top floor was painted yellow. 
    The newest building on the school was built over thirty years ago.
